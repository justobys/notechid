    <h1>User Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 23, 2025</p>
    <p>The <strong>AutoPostImage</strong> application was designed with your privacy as a priority.</p>

    <h3>Our Principle</h3>
    <p>Our application <strong>DOES NOT</strong> collect, process, or store any personal data from your Facebook account on our servers or databases. All operations, such as publishing content, are performed directly through the Facebook API using a temporary token granted with your permission.</p>

    <h3>No Data to Delete</h3>
    <p>Because we do not store your data, there is no data to be deleted from our systems.</p>

    <h3>How to Revoke Application Access (Delete the Connection)</h3>
    <p>If you no longer wish to use our application and want to ensure the connection between the app and your Facebook account is completely severed, you can do so easily through your Facebook settings.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to your Facebook account.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings & Privacy</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the left-hand menu, scroll down and click on <strong>Apps and Websites</strong>.</li>
        <li>Find the <strong>AutoPostImage</strong> application in the list.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Remove</strong> button next to the application's name.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, all permissions you granted to our application will be revoked, and the app will no longer be able to access your Facebook Page.</p>
